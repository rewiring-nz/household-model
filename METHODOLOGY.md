# Methodology

## Energy prices

We use average pricing over the next 15 years (real pricing, as opposed to nominal pricing). This is the average of the next 15 years of energy prices, projected out from today's prices at current real inflation rates. This is calculated using the average inflation from 2000 onwards for each energy type, using Stats NZ Quarterly Consumer Price Index History.
