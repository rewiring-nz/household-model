# openapi-client
This is the API for a household savings model. You can provide details about a household's energy use, and receive information about the household's potential emissions & cost savings from electrifying their fossil fuel machines, as well as the upfront costs of switching.

The `openapi_client` package is automatically generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project:

- API version: 0.0.3
- Package version: 1.0.0
- Generator version: 7.7.0
- Build package: org.openapitools.codegen.languages.PythonPydanticV1ClientCodegen

## Requirements.

Python 3.7+

## Installation & Usage

This python library package is generated without supporting files like setup.py or requirements files

To be able to use it, you will need these dependencies in your own package that uses this library:

* urllib3 >= 1.25.3
* python-dateutil
* pydantic
* aenum

## Getting Started

In your own code, to use this library to connect and interact with openapi-client,
you can run the following:

```python

import time
import openapi_client
from openapi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to http://localhost
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(
    host = "http://localhost"
)



# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with openapi_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = openapi_client.SavingsApi(api_client)
    household = openapi_client.Household() # Household | Input a household's energy behaviour

    try:
        # Calculate savings & get upfront cost
        api_response = api_instance.calculate_savings(household)
        print("The response of SavingsApi->calculate_savings:\n")
        pprint(api_response)
    except ApiException as e:
        print("Exception when calling SavingsApi->calculate_savings: %s\n" % e)

```
